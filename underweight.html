        <br><h2>What does underweight mean?</h2><br>
        <p> Being underweight means you are below the healthy weight range — the weight that research has shown you need to be if your body is to work properly.<br>
           Being outside this range, whether overweight or underweight, can seriously affect your health.

            <h2>Causes of Underweight :</h2>
              <br><br>
             <ul >
                <li><p><u>Family history</u>: Some people have a naturally low BMI due to physical characteristics that run in their family.</p></li><br>
               <li><p><u>A high metabolism</u> If a person has a high metabolism, they may not gain much weight even when eating high-energy foods.</p></li><br>
                <li><p><u>Frequent physical activity</u> Athletes or people who engage in high levels of physical activity, such as runners, may burn significant amounts of calories that result in low body weight.</p></li><br>
                <li><p><u>Physical illness or chronic disease</u> Some disease types can cause regular nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, making it difficult to gain weight.</p></li><br>

          <h2> What are the health risks of being underweight?</h2><br>
          <p>
            Studies have shown that underweight people suffer from nutritional deficiencies, which increases their risk of developing several impairing diseases significantly. </p>
            <br><br><h2>Health risks associated with being underweight include:</h2> <br>
              <ul >
                  <li><p><u>Gradual bone loss</u>:Low BMI has been strongly associated with reduced bone mineral density. 
                A study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice stated that being underweight increases women’s risk of developing osteoporosis, a bone disease characterised by excessive bone loss making the bones brittle and prone to fractures.</p></li><br>
                <li><p><u>Reduced immune function</u>:A review study published in the Journal of Nutrition stated that protein deficiency in people with low BMI results in the decreased production of white blood cells and antibodies in response to a viral infection. 
                It has also been established that in the absence of enough protein, fat, and other nutrients in the body, the immune system of underweight people works inefficiently. </p></li><br>
                <li><p><u>Heart diseases</u>: Minerals such as potassium, sodium, and calcium are required to maintain a steady heartbeat. The imbalance of these essential minerals in malnourished underweight people results in improper heart rhythms (arrhythmias).
                 A study published in the journal Medicine in 2017 found that out of <u>491,773</u> participants, underweight participants were at<u>19.7%</u> higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases than the normal-weight participants. 
                 Studies also reveal that underweight people are prone to develop heart diseases such as mitral valve prolapse (bulging of the valves of the heart), arrhythmias, and even heart failure. </p></li><br>
                <li><p><u>Skin and hair problems</u>: Due to the lack of enough nutrients in the body, underweight people tend to experience thinning and drying of the skin along with excessive hair fall.  </p></li><br>
                <li><p><u>Irregular menstrual cycle</u>: Underweight women may experience irregular, delayed or absence of periods. Persistent irregularity or absence of menses can also result in infertility.</p></li><br>  
               <li><p><u>Preterm labour</u>: A research published in the journal BJOG in 2016 found that underweight pregnant women are at increased risk of delivering the baby before 37 weeks of gestation. 
                A premature baby can have long-lasting intellectual as well as developmental disabilities.</p></li><br>
